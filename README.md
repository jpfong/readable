# Readable API Server

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Start Developing

To launch the app:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
